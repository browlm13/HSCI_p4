	-if i know the tolerence level i should be able to find approximatley the Rn+k that gives a value 
		as accurate

	- i can use this value to make sure the tolernce level is aceptible with Rn if it get close to Rn+k within the deiserd tolerence

	thoughts:

		if the diffrence between Rn and Rn+k is of acceptible tolerence, then it is very likley 
		that the true value is also in that accepted tolerance

		if not both Rn+k and Rn have to be changed, that is n has to be increased but it should be increased inteligently.




		chosing n and k values:

			initial choice: 	Since i have a mean convergece rate and sd I should be able to calculate the approximate number of subintervals needed to get the desierd accuray:

				formula:
